# Investigating-Prosper-Loan-Data
In this project, I conducted an Explanatory Data Analysis on a dataset which contains 113,937 loan with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate),current loan status, borrower income, and many others from Prosper. Prosper is America's first marketplace lending platform with over 9 billion dollars in funded loans. I will be looking at different factors that influences the Loan status outcome, Borrowers rate, and Lenders yield and how these factors acts as criterias that determines the Loan amount each borrowers qualifies to obtain.
